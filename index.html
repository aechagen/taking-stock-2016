		<section id="conclusion">
			<h1>All in all..</h1>
			<p>I had a great year with my family. Our youngest son Ethan was born with complications, but with the strength of my wife and the help of our families, we were able to make it through. I got a new brother-in-law when Nieves and Carl -finally- got married, and got to experience living with another.</p>
			<p>Some of my goals and personal conquests didn't quite work out: getting out of the military, buying a house, and even starting to make consistent income from web development projects on the side. It's all good though, life happens. With the new year, I'm going to try and keep making myself better. I'll continue to make positive moves while always keeping my family in mind and let the rest play itself out.</p>
